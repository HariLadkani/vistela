Vistela is an intelligent video platform that helps viewers consume long videos within strict time limits.

Instead of generating short clips, the system creates time-constrained video summaries that preserve the most important concepts and narrative flow. Users specify how much time they have, and the platform produces a condensed version of the video that fits that duration while retaining critical information.

The goal is to make long-form educational, technical, and informational videos easier to consume when time is limited without losing context or meaning.
